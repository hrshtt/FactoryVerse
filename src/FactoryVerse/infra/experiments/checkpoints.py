"""
Checkpoint Management for FactoryVerse

This module provides checkpoint functionality for experiments, including:
- Saving Factorio game state
- Extracting agent notebook state
- Managing checkpoint metadata
- Restoring from checkpoints

Note: This is currently a stub implementation. The actual checkpoint
functionality requires integration with Factorio RCON and Jupyter kernel
state extraction, which will be implemented in future iterations.

# Future implementation notes:
#
# The full checkpoint implementation will require:
#
# 1. Factorio RCON Integration:
#    - Connect to Factorio server via RCON
#    - Get current game tick: /sc return game.tick
#    - Trigger save: /server-save {name}
#    - Handle save file paths and container volume mounts
#
# 2. Jupyter Kernel State Extraction:
#    - Connect to Jupyter server API
#    - Get kernel state for each agent notebook
#    - Extract variables, execution history, cell outputs
#    - Serialize state for storage
#
# 3. State Restoration:
#    - Copy save file to Factorio saves directory
#    - Restart Factorio with specific save file
#    - Restore notebook states in Jupyter kernels
#    - Resume experiment with restored state
#
# 4. Error Handling:
#    - Validate checkpoint integrity
#    - Handle missing save files
#    - Graceful fallback for failed restores
#    - Cleanup on errors
