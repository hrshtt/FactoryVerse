# Reminders for Tomorrow

- [x] Ensure symmetric usage of technology with research and recipes with crafting.
- [x] Technology and recipes need to be part of the top-level affordances (reachable, map, ghost builder, inventory).
- [x] Understand recipes and find a clean way to integrate recipe and technology types into the top-level research and crafting affordances.
- [ ] Fix Map DB not automatically updating when entities are removed (confirmed 100% not updating on removal; verify placement updates).
- [ ] Confirm if mining resource entities (trees and rocks) is still working (verify nearest implementation).
- [ ] Simplify the system prompt (Target: ~6000 tokens total):
    - [ ] Instructions and explanations of the DSL and observation tools: ~500-1000 tokens.
    - [ ] Explaining Factorio gameplay and mindfulness: 500 tokens.
    - [ ] Initial state documentation: ~500 tokens.
- [ ] Figure out how to do a claude code based run and execute it eventually.
- [ ] Implement belt lines-based ghosts (ghost-only placement across the map without reachability constraints).
- [ ] Test build ghosts functionality (not done at all yet).
- [ ] Fix and test status dump and integration
- [ ] Hash and compare statistics for global production and append only new changes?
- [ ] Take a break! (You've been at this for a long time).
